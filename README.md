# Hacker Feed

> Improved Hacker News UI written using Angular JS, NodeJS and Express.

> Hacker News from Y Incubator is the leading source of technology news. Thousands of stories are shared weekly on this site. The only problem with Hacker News is their user interface looks like it was written in the Dark Ages.

> Hacker Feed greatly improves the user interface with our sleek single page design. Hacker Feed allows you to overcome the weakness that is inherent at Hacer News. With thousands of articles posted weekly it is almost impossible to find articles written by people that you deem important. With Hacker Feed we provide the opportunity to actually follow people. Just click on your personal page and you will only see articles posted from the people that you select to follow.
